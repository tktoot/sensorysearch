          <p>SensorySearch was created by a dad for families navigating the world with sensory needs.</p>

          <p>
            It was inspired by the real-life experience of a family raising a four-year-old son with autism, and
            understanding how isolating it can feel when the world isn't always built for inclusion.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our mission is to make it easier for families, individuals, and communities to discover sensory-friendly
            spaces â€” places that feel welcoming, supportive, and inclusive for everyone.
          </p>

          <p>
            From peaceful restaurants to inclusive events and calm play spaces, SensorySearch helps you find comfort,
            understanding, and belonging, one pin at a time.
          </p>

          <p className="font-semibold text-gradient">Together, we can help make every community more inclusive.</p>
